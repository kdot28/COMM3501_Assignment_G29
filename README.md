**Please ensure the data is in your relevant working directory and you may have to adjust the file path in the EDA code.**


Other than that, the code should run in any order (package installations may be required) since the cleaned dataset has been saved. (cleaned_data_v3).
If the code does not run, please run the EDA code first OR save ‘cleaned_data_v3’ in the same working directory.
